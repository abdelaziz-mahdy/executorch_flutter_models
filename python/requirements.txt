# ExecuTorch Flutter Plugin - Model Export Dependencies
#
# This file contains the Python dependencies required to export
# PyTorch models to ExecuTorch format for use with the Flutter plugin.
#
# Requirements:
# - Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
# - Consider using a virtual environment (conda or venv)
#
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core packages with tested compatible versions
executorch==1.0.1       # ExecuTorch export library
torch>=2.9.0            # PyTorch (2.9.x compatible with ExecuTorch 1.0.1)
torchvision>=0.24.0     # For pretrained models (MobileNet, etc.)

# YOLO models
ultralytics>=8.3.0      # For YOLO object detection, pose, and face models

# ONNX conversion (required for BlazeFace and MoveNet)
onnx>=1.20.0            # ONNX model format
onnx2torch>=1.5.0       # ONNX to PyTorch conversion

# Optional: TensorFlow dependencies (required for MoveNet export)
# Note: TensorFlow can have compatibility issues on some systems
# Uncomment if you need to export MoveNet models:
# tensorflow>=2.15.0
# tensorflow_hub
# tf2onnx

# Optional: Apple backend support (macOS/iOS)
# coremltools>=9.0      # For CoreML backend

# Utilities
numpy                   # For tensor operations
pillow                  # For image processing

# Development and testing (optional)
# pytest
